This project analyzes the real world workout data I have gathered using my WorkoutBot.

To run create a venv with:

python -m venv venv

activate it and install requiements with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

In order to run the program you will need a dump of the database from the workout bot and you may have to change the credentials in dbConnector.py to match your MySQL configuration.
